# Analyzing Data using PowerPivot in Excel

This project demonstrates how to model and analyze data in Excel using Power Pivot, focusing on loading datasets (Orders, Customers, Products), creating relationships, calculating profit, and identifying repeat customers using DAX formulas. By establishing one-to-many relationships between tables and using formulas like RELATED to calculate profit and CALCULATE with ALLEXCEPT to flag repeat customers, users can gain insights into customer behavior. Visual tools like Pivot Tables, Line Charts, and Heat Maps help interpret the data, making Power Pivot a powerful tool for large dataset analysis.

# Software

I used MS-Excel for Windows to access Powerpivot as it was not available on Mac.
